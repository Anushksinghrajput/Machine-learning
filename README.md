TASK-1 :*Credit Card Fraud Detection*

Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. It is designed to provide an efficient and effective method for detecting unusual activity and preventing financial loss. The project utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to analyze transaction data and detect patterns that may indicate fraud.

Features
Transaction Classification: Classifies credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
Real-Time Detection: The system is capable of real-time fraud detection, flagging suspicious transactions as they occur.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) trained on a dataset of credit card transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and balancing to ensure model accuracy.
Visualization: Interactive visualizations to understand model performance and detect trends in fraudulent transactions.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning Algorithms: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Storage: Firebase/BigQuery (optional for live applications)
Cloud Services: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Frameworks: TensorFlow (if deep learning is used)
