TASK-1 :*Credit Card Fraud Detection*

Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. It is designed to provide an efficient and effective method for detecting unusual activity and preventing financial loss. The project utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to analyze transaction data and detect patterns that may indicate fraud.

Features
Transaction Classification: Classifies credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
Real-Time Detection: The system is capable of real-time fraud detection, flagging suspicious transactions as they occur.
Model Training: Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) trained on a dataset of credit card transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and balancing to ensure model accuracy.
Visualization: Interactive visualizations to understand model performance and detect trends in fraudulent transactions.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning Algorithms: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Storage: Firebase/BigQuery (optional for live applications)
Cloud Services: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Frameworks: TensorFlow (if deep learning is used)
Installation
To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/anushka-singh-rajput/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Model
Prepare the dataset (dataset.csv or another format) by following the instructions in the data_preprocessing.py file.

Train the model by running:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
For real-time detection or simulation, run:

bash
Copy code
python real_time_detection.py
Data Privacy
Ensure that you follow proper data privacy regulations when using real credit card data. Only anonymized datasets should be used for model training and testing.
